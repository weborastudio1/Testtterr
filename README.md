## Important production notes
1. The forms intentionally use `mailto:` because no verified server-side form endpoint was supplied in the source. Replace the mailto flow with your preferred backend (EmailJS/Firebase/own API) once credentials and the production storage rules are ready.
2. Career resumes are not uploaded by the static site. The form validates the selected file and asks the applicant to attach it to the opened email.
3. The legal pages avoid inventing a legal entity name, registration number or jurisdiction city. Fill those in once the exact legal details are confirmed.
4. The public credentials page is verification-first. Add certificate copies and official verification links only after checking them.
5. External portfolio demo links are shown as supplied destinations; their hosting and availability are outside this site.
6. Before production launch, test all external demos, email/WhatsApp links, contact form behaviour, DNS/SSL, Search Console and PageSpeed.
